US-BikeShare-Data-Analysis
======

Udacity Data Analyst Degree

Overview
------

This project aims to analyze data from bike share systems in three major US cities, namely Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a program to import the data and calculate descriptive statistics to answer interesting questions about it. Additionally, I will develop a script that can take user input and provide an interactive experience in the terminal to present the computed statistics.

What Software Do I Need?
------

To complete this project, i'll require the following softwares:

Python
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
* A terminal application

The Datasets
----
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

Answering Questions
------
Through writing code, I'm able to answer the following questions about the bike share data:

* What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?
* What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
* What month occurs most often in the start time?
* What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
* What are the counts of gender?
* What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
* What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
* What are the counts of each user type?
* What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
